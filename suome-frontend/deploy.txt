- run yarn build when you think you want to deploy
- this will generate some new files, you need to add them to git and push to our repo
ssh albara1@magi.cs.aalto.fi
ssh suomea.cs.aalto.fi
- get into our frontend folder
cd /home/liang/suomea/frontend
- run sudo git pull, now the server folder should pull the latest changes you've pushed
- then run sudo pm2 restart all
